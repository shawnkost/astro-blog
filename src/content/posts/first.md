Over the course of a project a software team will conduct regular meetings. Because developer time is so expensive and software development is such a time-consuming endeavor, it's important to be strategic about how meetings are structured.

Each morning, we will be conducting “Daily Stand Up”. This is a team meeting during which the class will gather and give a general status report.

Daily Stand Up is a common practice among software teams. It is called a "stand up" because attendees traditionally stay standing during the meeting. This tactic is intended to keep the meeting short because everyone is standing, waiting to get back to work (sitting). Some agile methodologies call this practice Scrum, named after how a rugby team huddles together at the beginning of a play.

## Overview

A well conducted Daily Stand Up is intended to achieve the following goals:

- Get everyone working toward the same goals.
- Re-balance workload so that team members don't stay stuck.
- (Briefly) call out difficulties and highlight achievements.
- Bolster team spirit.

The primary type of Daily Stand Up that we'll be conducting during your final project answers three questions:

1. **What did you do yesterday?**

   This can be as small as completing a few tasks on a GitHub Issue, or as large as finishing an entire feature. It's important to be as detailed as you can, so come to Stand Up prepared with your Issue open so you can simply read from it.

1. **What are you doing today?**

   It's okay to be conservative here, but be specific. If you have a task list for your next GitHub Issue, then read the task list. If you don't have a task list, but know what feature or bug you're tackling, then say so. If you don't know what you are doing next, then state that you still need to decide what you're going to work on. A teammate might need some help so you can state that you're available to help.

1. **What is blocking you?**

   During the course of a final project, it is _exceedingly rare_ that anybody is truly blocked. More often, students are simply "stuck". It's okay to be stuck. Part of a developer's work is to solve problems that nobody else in the business is prepared to tackle. Often this involves being "stuck" doing research, reading documentation, or prototyping solutions. Voicing this during Stand Up is also okay. It gives your instructor an opportunity to help.

### How It's Done

Before each Stand Up, open your task management tools (GitHub Issues). Review your completed items carefully. When it is your turn to participate, answer the following questions:

- Yesterday I worked on ... (read from your task management tools). Be clear and specific.
- Today I am working on ... (read from your task management tools). Be specific and realistic.
- MAYBE - I am stuck on ... and I am planning on getting unstuck by ... Be specific and ask for help if you need it. It's also worth putting your plan for getting _unstuck_ in your task management tools.

It's important to be concise and direct when checking in during Daily Stand Up. It's equally important to stay positive. Sometimes work gets tough, but professional developers already know that, so Daily Stand Up is not the time to complain about things.

### End-of-day

At the end of each day, be sure to set aside 10-15 minutes to consider the following things:

1. **How far did you get with today's goals?**

   The intent is to communicate with your team and Project Manager about what tasks were completed and what tasks were left undone. Some days rock and a bunch of tasks are knocked out. Other days, not too much gets finished. Things come up. Unforeseen problems arise, but everyone should know what's going on.

1. **What are you going to mention at Daily Stand Up tomorrow**?

   Preparing for Daily Stand Up is best done the day _before_. This help keep Stand Up brief so your team can hit the ground running every single day.

After a few days of practice, you will come to enjoy Daily Stand Up and you might be surprised just how efficient meetings can be!
